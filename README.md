# ExtremeFakeItTillYouMakeIt
Example of Extreme Refactoring to emergent design 

This was an experiment with the Bowling Kata to explore pushing fake it till you make it a bit farther than normal.

The process was 
Red -> Green -> Refactor (44 times) 

I tried to checkin on each refactoring (with a successful test run)
